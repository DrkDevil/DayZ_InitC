# DayZ_InitC
This is my DayZ init.c file I used for the DayZ n' Chill Servers.

# Features
In this init.c your servers players will start off naked and with no gear if they use the in game default name "Survivor"
After Selecting a name your players will start on the server with random items set in the config portion of the file. 

You can set how many of the random medical items are given to each player to start

You can set the percentage chance of starting with a backpack or melee weapon. 

Simple legible structure so that all features can easily be duplicated or changed to supprt other weapons or items. 

Seaonsonal Setting. 
Set starting items for XMAS. I will soon add additional holidays like Halloween, and Easter.
